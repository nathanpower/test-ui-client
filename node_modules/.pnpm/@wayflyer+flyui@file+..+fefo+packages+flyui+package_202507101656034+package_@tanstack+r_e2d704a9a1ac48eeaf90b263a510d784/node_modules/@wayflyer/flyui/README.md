FlyUI is Wayflyer's user interface component library. It helps us to efficiently build high quality, robust user experiences for our customers.

- The project encompasses not just the delivery of our UI but the practices, tooling, documentation and infrastructure to support our UI engineers.
- It provides us the ability to share progress with our stakeholders and quality assure our user experiences before we ship to production.
- It sets up frameworks for testing to ensure our UI works now, and continues to work as we ship new features.
- It allows us to scale our engineering more effectively by reducing the amount of system context a UI developer requires before they can start delivering code.
- It drives a rapid iteration cycle by allowing easy interrogation of the user experience without having to be connected to the backend.
- Separates the delivery of UI and backend code to allow these work streams to run concurrently.
- This drives our capability to quickly deliver new features with high confidence that we are shipping working code and an excellent UX, while not breaking anything.

## Mission statement

FlyUI was originally built as a library that exported fully-composed screen-level interfaces, back when there was essentially only one engineering team delivering UI. Now that the organisition has scaled and split into product-focused pods, it makes sense to expose a lower level of abstraction and facilitate UI composition in the consuming applications. To this end we are now moving towards refactoring FlyUI to be the component library implementation of the [Wayflyer Design System specification](https://www.figma.com/files/1085174594297070258/project/62516860/Design-Kit?fuid=977482556682004509), and we are establishing a governance model around this.

**What this will mean in practice:**

- Reduced API surface
  - Similar components consolidated
  - Components that do not meet the spec deprecated
  - Product specific components moved out into consumer code
- New components / additional features should go requested from `@fefo-support`
- Detailed documentation for all components that are exported
- All spacing, colors, typography etc. centrally managed by a token system that integrates with Figma
- Design approval on all visible changes
- Accessibility testing for all components

The `@wayflyer/fefo` team will endeavour to fix any breaking changes as this process is ongoing, it should not impact product teams significantly.

## FAQ

### I need to make a UI component, how do I know if it belongs in FlyUI or not?

Such a component should be:

- Approved by Design System team to form part of the Wayflyer Design System
- Used by, or intended to be used by, more than one project
- Generic enough to be used in different contexts
- No domain-specific naming in external API, or business logic in internal code
- Prop-driven - no network interaction

### Can I make contributions to FlyUI?

PRs very welcome, particularly bugfixes. Probably worth asking in the `#eng-front-end` Slack channel before working on any large changes or features.
